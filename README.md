Processor:  It is the heart of SoC, usually SoC contains at least one or more than one coprocessor. It can be a microcontroller, microprocessor, or DSP. Most of the time DSP is used in every SoC as a processor.

DSP: DSP stands for Digital Signal Processor. It is included in SoC to perform signal processing operations such as data collection, data processing, etc. it is also used for the purpose of decoding the images.

Memory: Memory is used in SoC for the purpose of storage. It may be a volatile or non-volatile memory. Volatile memory includes RAM there are two types of RAM one is SRAM and another is DRAM. The non-volatile memory includes ROM.

Encoder/Decoder: Used for the purpose of interrupting information and converting it into codes.

Network Interface card: SoC has an internal interface or bus or network to connect all individual blocks. Basically, the Network interface card provides a connection of the network to the system.

GPU: GPU stands for Graphical Processing Unit, used in SoC to visualize the interface. GPU is specially designed to speed up the operations related to image calculations. The basic blocks of the GPU are the Bus interface, Power Management Unit, Video Processing unit, Graphics Memory Controller, Display interface, etc.

Peripheral devices: Externally connected devices/interfaces such as USB, HDMI, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are included in peripheral devices. This device is used in SoC to perform various operations.

UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter is included in SoC which is used to transmit or receive serial data. Voltage regulators, Oscillators, clocks, and ADC/DAC are also part of SoC.


### üîπ Why BabySoC?

1. Baby SoC ‚Äì Overview (In Depth)

A Baby SoC is a miniaturized System on Chip, designed primarily as a learning, experimental, and prototyping platform for students, engineers, and researchers to understand SoC design from RTL to silicon.

Definition:
A SoC integrates all major components of a computer or embedded system‚ÄîCPU, memory, peripherals‚Äîonto a single chip. A Baby SoC simplifies this by including only the essential components, typically one CPU core, small memories, and basic peripherals, while still demonstrating real SoC concepts like instruction execution, memory access, and peripheral interfacing.

The Figuare below shows how baby SOC look like 

<img width="1033" height="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c963d5c-a33f-4b2f-8c42-6ac8f302a8c7" />

Purpose and Goals:

Educational: Helps students grasp concepts like RTL design, bus protocols, CPU-memory-peripheral interaction, and verification.

Hands-on Design Experience: Enables simulation, synthesis, and optionally FPGA implementation or ASIC tapeout.

Proof-of-Concept Platform: Demonstrates integration of CPU, memory, and peripherals without the complexity of a full-scale commercial SoC.

Exploration of RTL-to-GDSII Flow: Users can learn end-to-end chip design, including:

RTL Design: Writing Verilog/SystemVerilog for CPU, memory, bus, and peripherals.

Functional Verification: Testbenches, simulation, waveform analysis, assertion-based verification.

Synthesis: Converting RTL into gate-level netlist using tools like Yosys.

Place-and-Route: Mapping netlist onto FPGA or ASIC standard cells.

Timing Analysis: Ensuring the design meets target frequency using STA (Static Timing Analysis).

Tapeout (Optional): Using open-source PDKs like Sky130 for real silicon fabrication.

Architecture Philosophy:

Keep it small but representative: Demonstrates the entire SoC design lifecycle.

Focus on modularity: Each component (CPU, memory, peripherals) is a standalone RTL block with well-defined interfaces.

Emphasize interconnectivity: The bus/interconnect is central, showing how data and instructions flow across the chip.

Introduce verification mindset: Even a Baby SoC requires testbenches, monitors, scoreboards, and assertions for functional correctness.

2. Baby SoC ‚Äì Components 

Let‚Äôs break down all components with their purpose, design considerations, and interaction with other blocks.

### üîπ Role of Functional Modelling in Baby SOC

Functional Modelling (FM) creates a high-level simulation of the SoC before RTL or hardware implementation. It is crucial for early verification, error detection, and design exploration.

Key Points:

Early Verification: Simulates CPU, memory, bus, and peripherals to catch design flaws before RTL.

Faster Development: FM in Python/SystemC/MATLAB is quicker than RTL synthesis or FPGA testing.

Design Exploration: Allows testing different configurations (memory size, bus width, instruction set) efficiently.

Error Detection: Detects instruction execution, memory access, and communication issues early.

Educational & Learning Tool: Helps understand SoC component interactions without low-level hardware details.

Supports Co-Simulation: FM can integrate with RTL or FPGA simulations to validate functionality and timing together.

Components Modeled:

CPU: Executes instructions; checks pipelines.

Instruction & Data Memory (IMEM & DMEM): Verifies read/write operations.

Peripherals (UART, GPIO, Timers): Ensures correct I/O interaction.

Bus/Interconnect: Validates communication and arbitration.

Clock & Reset: Checks synchronous operation and system reset.
